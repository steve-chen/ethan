        <h2>October 2024 - Autumn in New York</h2>
        <div class="entry-preview">
            <img src="/api/placeholder/400/300" alt="Central Park in autumn" class="image-left lightbox-image">
            <p>The crisp autumn air in New York City was invigorating. Central Park was a canvas of reds, oranges, and yellows. I spent hours wandering through the winding paths, taking in the breathtaking foliage.</p>
            <p>Later, I visited the Empire State Building. The view of the city bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun was unforgettable. The city's energy was palpable even from high above.</p>
            <div class="fade-out"></div>

        <div class="entry-full">
            <img src="/api/placeholder/300/400" alt="Empire State Building view" class="image-right lightbox-image">
            <p>My visit coincided with the New York Film Festival, adding an extra layer of excitement to the trip. I managed to attend a few screenings and even spotted some celebrities on the red carpet!</p>
            <p>One of the highlights of my trip was a boat tour around Manhattan. Seeing the city skyline from the water gave me a whole new perspective on its grandeur. The Statue of Liberty, standing tall and proud, was particularly moving to see up close.</p>
            <img src="/api/placeholder/500/300" alt="Manhattan skyline from water" class="image-center lightbox-image">
            <p>I also spent an afternoon exploring the vibrant neighborhoods of Brooklyn. From the trendy shops in Williamsburg to the historic brownstones in Park Slope, each area had its own distinct character. I ended the day watching the sunset from Brooklyn Bridge Park, with the Manhattan skyline providing a stunning backdrop.</p>
            <p>Food was another highlight of the trip. From grabbing a quick slice of New York pizza to indulging in a fancy dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant, every meal was an adventure. I particularly enjoyed exploring the various ethnic cuisines available in the city, from authentic Chinese in Flushing to mouthwatering Italian in Little Italy.</p>
            <img src="/api/placeholder/300/400" alt="New York street food" class="image-left lightbox-image">
            <p>As my trip came to an end, I realized that New York in autumn is truly magical. The combination of the changing seasons, the city's energy, and the wealth of cultural experiences made for an unforgettable journey. I left with a camera full of photos, a heart full of memories, and a strong desire to return soon.</p>
